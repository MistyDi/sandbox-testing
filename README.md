> This is my sandbox to try several features and technologies I want to try 
  to get familiar with. While working on my last job at AI-startup I was faced 
  with tasks, that I think could be (or even must be) simplified or automated.
> This happened while:
> - working/preparing of virtual environments on different machines
> - working with git-repo stuff (branching, managing features/issues)
> - manual testing of my/others code working
